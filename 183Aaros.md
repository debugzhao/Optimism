# {183Aaros}

1.  About me: Hey, I'm 183Aaros, a member of OPCN and one of the tutors of the OP co-learning this time. I'm delighted to learn the fundamentals of OP together with everyone here. Here's my personal web if you're interested in know more about me :) -> 183aaros.notion.site

Optimism Co-learning Notes, day1: 

#### OP and OP Rollup

Dedication:
scaling Ethereum's tech
expanding its ability
coordinape ppl world-wide to build decentralised economies+governance systems

Principle:
impact=profit

OP Collective:
Builds open-source software

OP Stack:
decentralised software stack
backbone of blockchains i.e. OP Mainnet& base

OP Rollups:
Leverage the consensus mechanism of L1

#### Block

Block storage:
using non-contract address(for min gas) on ETH
write in compressed format
transaction anti-censorship via EIP-4844 blobs
inherits ETH availability& integrity

Biobiography:
https://specs.optimism.io/

### 2025.01.07

Key takeaway:

#### OP Mainnet Transaction fee
Transaction fee [Execution Gas Fee(Base fee, Priority fee), L1 Data Fee]

#### L1 Data Fee，Ecotone:
(1)tx_compressed_size = [(count_zero_bytes(tx_data)*4 + count_non_zero_bytes(tx_data)*16)] / 16

(2)
weighted_gas_price = 16*base_fee_scalar*base_fee + blob_base_fee_scalar*blob_base_fee

L1 Data Fee, Ecotone = (1) * (2)

#### L1 Data Fee，Fjord
L1 Data Fee，Fjord(FastLZ-compressed size, base fee/ blob base fee):

(1) estimatedSizeScaled = max(minTransactionSize * 1e6, intercept + fastlzCoef*fastlzSize)

(2)l1FeeScaled = baseFeeScalar*l1BaseFee*16 + blobFeeScalar*l1BlobBaseFee

where both scalars are scaled by 1e6,

thus,

L1cost = (1)*(2)/1e12

#### Biobiography:
https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees

### 2025.01.08

Key takeaway:

Stage 0 - Full training wheels, still an source available software allows reconstruction of the state.

 - rollup
 - state roots
 - provide DA (data availability) on L1
 - reconstructiion of state source available

Stage 1 - Limited ~, governed by smart contract, council implementation for security.

- proper proof system
- fraud proof
- user may exit without oper's coordination
- 7 days exit window
- 50% of the security council participants from external

Stage 2 - No ~, final stage, no council.

- permissionless
- 30 days exit window
- Security Council restricted to errors detected

### 2025.01.09
The learning material today I choose from, has head back to VB's original articles on scaling, which inspring the design of Optimism.

Key takeaway: (mainly focus the aspect of VB's analytical framework)

Some prior background - Blockchain scaling/decentralised/safety triangle dillema etc.

Identify the problem 
- the consensus architectures rely on every node processing every transaction

When it comes to soluions, one particular thing that really stand out is, 
VB has assessed many factors even potential growth model and how would these model choices could end up with.
i.e. Batching vs. other solutions, in a sense of the comparison of a linea growth model solution vs. exponential growth model, but with a trade-off (i.e. ETH 2.0, a trade-off of the dev cycle).

At the very last part of the article, VB has mentioned shadow chain, we can see the idea that inspired Optimism Rollups. From the analytical thinking side, he identified the trade-offs, and can also see how his analytical framework constructs the original version of L2 solution that temporarily compromises, but better for solving the trilemma in the long run.

#### Optimism Collective
- a collective of companies + communities + citizens working together
       - to reward publicgood
       - build a sustainable future for Ethereum

#### Vision
- standardization
- Supechain scales
- governance protect security
- governance creates flywheel of sustainable growth and dev

#### Mission
- to create an internet that benefits all and is owned by none

#### Governance
- digital democratic governance consists of 2 houses
- Token house: submitting, deliberating, voting on various types of governance proposals.
    - vote directly
    - delegate
- Citizen house: 1 person = 1 vote, also responsible for RPGF (Retro Funding);
    - reduce concentration of power
    - safeguard against capture of Token House (whales etc.)
    - Allocate resources for long-term benefit

- Key Governance Structure
The Optimism Collective employs a unique two-house governance system:

Token House: Comprised of OP token holders
Responsible for:
Submitting governance proposals
Deliberating on proposals
Voting on various governance matters

Citizens' House: Composed of Optimism Citizens
Primary functions:
- Allocating retroactive public goods funding
- Voting on proposal vetoes
- Providing a check-and-balance mechanism
- Governance Process
- Proposal Lifecycle
-Three-week cycle for most proposals
-Weeks 1-2: Feedback and review period
-Week 3: Voting period

Key Requirements

Proposals must be:
Submitted to the Governance Forum
- Marked with [Draft] initially
Require approval from:
- 4 top 100 delegates (Token House)
- 4 Citizens (Citizens' House)

Voting Mechanics
Token House Voting
Quorum: 30% of votable OP supply
Approval Threshold: 51-76% of votes (varies by proposal type)

Citizens' House Voting
Based on percentage of total Citizens
Includes veto rights for certain proposals
Valid Proposal Types

Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding)
A unique mechanism where Citizens vote to reward impactful public goods projects through:
