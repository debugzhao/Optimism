## Layer2 扩容方案 的补充材料

### What is Bedrock?
Bedrock is a major upgrade and the codebase architecture for Optimism. Optimism uses Optimistic Rollup technology to improve transaction throughput and reduce costs while inheriting the security of Ethereum. The Bedrock upgrade represents a fundamental shift in how Optimism operates, aiming for improved performance, modularity, and Ethereum equivalence.

**I. Key Features of Bedrock**

1. Enhanced Modularity:
  - Bedrock introduces a modular design for the Optimism stack. This modularity allows the Optimism network to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing requirements while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum.
  - Each component in the stack can be upgraded independently, ensuring easier maintenance and innovation.

2. Ethereum Equivalence:
- Bedrock moves Optimism closer to Ethereum equivalence, meaning the L2 operates more like the Ethereum mainnet. This simplifies interactions with Ethereum-native tools, applications, and smart contracts.
- Developers can seamlessly deploy applications on Optimism using the same tools and code as they would on Ethereum.

3. Optimized Rollup Architecture:
- Bedrock improves the rollup mechanics, including batch submission and fraud proofing.
- Transaction batch processing is streamlined, reducing latency and ensuring faster finality for transactions.

4. Lower Costs:
- The new architecture optimizes data compression and storage, which significantly reduces the cost of transactions on Optimism.
- By leveraging Ethereum's calldata efficiency, Bedrock makes it cheaper to post transaction data on the Ethereum mainnet.

5. Improved Syncing and Performance:
- Syncing between Optimism and Ethereum is faster under Bedrock.
- Transaction throughput and node performance are enhanced to support a growing user base and developer ecosystem.

6. Multi-Proof System:
- Bedrock introduces support for multi-proof systems, paving the way for advanced fraud proofs and better security for the rollup.

**II. Why Is Bedrock Important?**
- Scalability: With reduced costs and improved performance, Bedrock strengthens Optimism's ability to handle a higher transaction volume, making Ethereum-based applications more accessible to users.
- Developer Friendly: The Ethereum equivalence ensures that developers do not need to learn a new framework to build or deploy on Optimism.
- Interoperability: Bedrock's modularity and Ethereum compatibility promote interoperability with other Layer 2 solutions and Ethereum-based applications.
- Ecosystem Growth: Lower transaction fees and improved performance make Optimism an attractive platform for decentralized applications (dApps), boosting user adoption and network activity.

**III. Bedrock and the OP Stack**
The OP Stack is a set of standardized, open-source components for building scalable blockchains. Bedrock is a flagship implementation of the OP Stack, showcasing its potential as a robust L2 solution. Other projects can use the OP Stack to create their own rollups, contributing to the broader modular blockchain ecosystem.
Bedrock signifies a leap forward for Optimism and demonstrates how Layer 2 solutions can evolve to provide scalable, cost-efficient, and user-friendly infrastructure while staying closely aligned with Ethereum's values.


### What is EIP-4844?
EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal aimed at improving Ethereum's scalability, specifically for Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as rollups. It introduces blob-carrying transactions, a mechanism for handling large amounts of data more efficiently and at lower costs without permanently increasing the Ethereum blockchain's state size.

This proposal is a significant step toward full Danksharding, Ethereum's long-term vision for scalability through data sharding. EIP-4844 focuses on temporary data storage to support rollups and other scaling technologies, making transactions faster and cheaper for users.

**I. Key Features of EIP-4844**

1. Blob-Carrying Transactions:
  - EIP-4844 introduces a new type of transaction that carries blobs of data.
  - Blobs are large chunks of binary data designed to store rollup-related information.
  - These blobs are not stored permanently on the Ethereum blockchain but are instead available for a short period (e.g., a few weeks) to be processed by rollups.

2. Off-Chain Blob Storage:
- Blobs are stored off-chain, reducing the burden on the Ethereum blockchain's state.
- Validators and clients only need to verify the availability of these blobs for a limited time, ensuring data integrity while minimizing long-term storage requirements.

3. Lower Data Costs:
- The cost of including blob data in a transaction is significantly lower than the cost of storing data on-chain.
- This reduction in costs is a major benefit for L2 rollups, which rely on storing transaction data as calldata on Ethereum.

4. Improved Scalability for Rollups:
- Rollups (Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups) benefit from EIP-4844 because it provides a cost-effective way to publish their data to Ethereum.
- This enhances their throughput and reduces fees for end users.

5. Transition Toward Danksharding:
- EIP-4844 lays the groundwork for Danksharding, Ethereum’s full sharding design, which will implement multiple shard chains and significantly increase Ethereum’s data availability and scalability.
- Proto-Danksharding is a simpler, intermediate step to achieve some of the benefits of Danksharding without requiring the full sharding infrastructure immediately.

**II. Benefits of EIP-4844**

1. Lower Transaction Costs:
- By reducing the cost of storing rollup data, EIP-4844 helps bring down fees for rollup transactions, making Ethereum more affordable for users.
2. Better Scalability:
- The ability to handle large blobs of data without permanently increasing the blockchain size ensures Ethereum can support higher transaction volumes.
3. Rollup-Centric Ethereum (The "Rollup-Centric Roadmap"):
- Ethereum's scalability strategy focuses on rollups as the primary method for scaling. EIP-4844 directly enhances rollup efficiency, aligning with Ethereum's roadmap.
4. Minimal Impact on Ethereum Clients:
- The introduction of blobs is designed to minimize disruption to existing Ethereum clients while adding scalability improvements.

**III. Technical Overview of Blob Mechanics**

- Blob Size: Each blob is around 125 kB in size, optimized for storing rollup data.
- Data Availability Sampling (DAS): Validators ensure that blobs are available for the required period using data availability sampling techniques.
- Gas Cost: A new gas market for blob data is introduced, separate from Ethereum's normal gas mechanics, to ensure costs are predictable and fair.

**IV. Current Status of EIP-4844**

As of now:
- EIP-4844 is in development and under discussion in the Ethereum developer community.
- It is expected to be implemented in a future Ethereum upgrade (possibly in 2024–2025), following Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and related upgrades.

**In Summary**

EIP-4844 is a critical milestone in Ethereum's scaling journey. By introducing blob-carrying transactions and enabling cheaper data availability, it strengthens the foundation for rollup-centric scalability and moves Ethereum closer to its long-term vision of being a highly scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain.


### NOTES

### Block production

Have a mempool
- Tx submitted to sequencer are not censorship resistant because mempool is private.
- Tx can be submitted either directly to the sequencer or on L1's L2 block(in the second case, Tx is called deposits).

**Q:** 
Suppose the sequencer always follows the rules and doesn't commit any fraud, and the verifier keeps working to detect fraud but gets no incentives because no fraud is found. Would the verifier lose motivation to keep doing the verification work?

**A:** 
Yes, in the scenario where the sequencer always follows the rules and no fraud occurs, verifiers might lose motivation over time if they are not rewarded for their continuous efforts to monitor and validate transactions. This presents a potential challenge in systems like Optimistic Rollups, where fraud detection is a rare event. Verifiers still incur costs (e.g., computational resources, infrastructure) to monitor the sequencer, and without ongoing incentives, their participation could dwindle.

### Block execution
  
- Execution engine update using p2p network with other execution engines
- Rollup node derives L2 blocks from L1. (slower than the first one but censorship resistant)

### Bridging ETH or tokens between layers

- Moving from OP mainnet to Ethereum
- Withdrawal is finalized after the fault challenge period(a week on mainnet) ends.

**Q:** 
According to OP docs, the withdrawal from OP mainnet to Ethereum is finalized after the fault challenge period ends (a week on mainnet). Isn't one week too long for transactions to be finalized compared with traditional non-blockchain transactions?

**A:** 
Yes, the one-week challenge period for withdrawals from Optimism (OP) to Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) can feel long compared to traditional non-blockchain transactions, which are typically finalized almost instantly. This delay is a fundamental aspect of the Optimistic Rollup design, ensuring security through a fraud-proof mechanism. 

### Stage 的介绍

Framework to guid the progreassion of rollups from Stage 0 to Stage 2.

**Stage 0**
  - Call itself a rollup.
  - L2 state roots are posted on L1
  - Provide data availability on L1
  - Capable of reconstructing the rollup's state source

**Stage 1**
  - Use a proper proof system
  - at least  external actors that can submit a fraud proof. (Why 5?)
  - Users can exit without the operator's coordination
  - Users have at least 7days to exit in case of unwanted upgrades
  - Security council is properly set up

**Stage 2**
  - Fraud proof system is permissionless
  - Users have at least 30 days to exit in case of unwanted upgrades.
  - Security Council is restricted to act only due to errors detected on chain.

### 治理理念

**Design Principles**

- Governance minimization
- Iteration
- Forking
- Balance
- Impact = profit

The reward is from the centralized sequencer profits to Ethereum protocol development.

Retroactive rewards

**Optimism Collective: Token House + Citizens' House (bicameral governance system)**

- Token House vote based on tokens
  - Quorum: minimum number of OP votes, % of the total votable OP supply, as of the start of the voting period.
  - Approval threshold: % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of yes/no votes for a proposal.(Exclude abstain votes)
  - hosted on the Optimism Governance Portal.
- Citizen House vote based on one person one vote
  - Quorum: % of the total number of Citizens at the start of each Season.
  - Approval threshold: % of the total number of Citizens at the start of each Season.
  - Hosted on the Citizens’ House Snapshot Space
    
	(Source: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md)

**Q:** 

How are the Token House and Citizen House members elected? What are the differences?

**A:**

**Token House Election Process**
1. Delegate Nomination and Approval:
	- Self-Nomination: Individuals interested in becoming delegates can nominate themselves by submitting a delegate commitment, outlining their intentions and qualifications.
	- Delegate Approval: Certain positions, such as those on the Security Council, require nominations to receive explicit approvals from existing top delegates. For example, Security Council candidates need 8 Top 100 delegate approvals. 
2. Voting by Token Holders:
	- Voting Power: OP token holders can delegate their voting power to delegates who represent their interests in governance decisions.
	- Election Cycles: Elections are conducted during specific governance seasons, with defined timelines for nominations, approvals, and voting.
	- Approval Voting: Delegates are elected through approval voting, where token holders can vote for any number of nominees. The candidates with the most votes secure the positions. 
3. Term and Responsibilities:
	- Term Limits: Currently, there are no term limits for representatives, but this may change based on governance needs.
	- Roles: Delegates participate in various councils and boards, such as the Grants Council and Developer Advisory Board, influencing protocol upgrades, fund allocations, and other governance matters.
   
**Citizen House Election Process**
1. Citizenship Selection:
  - Identity-Based Membership: The Citizen House operates on a one-person-one-vote principle, focusing on individual human stakeholders like builders, users, and community members aligned with the project's values.
  - Initial Selection: Early participants were selected via a 'Web of Trust,' where known individuals were invited by the Optimism Foundation, Token House, past Retro Funding award winners, and existing badgeholders. 
2. Experimental Approaches:
  - Guest Voters: To refine the selection process, the Citizen House experiments with guest voters in Retro Funding rounds, allowing temporary participation to assess different selection mechanisms. 
  - Evolving Criteria: The criteria for citizenship are designed to evolve over time, informed by ongoing experimentation and community feedback, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of governance.
3. Deliberative Processes:
  - Collaborative Decision-Making: The Citizen House emphasizes deliberation, with members engaging in discussions to reach consensus on funding allocations and other decisions.
  - Ratification: Outcomes from deliberative processes are ratified by the full Citizen House before implementation, ensuring collective agreement.

**Q:**

Are there any rewards or incentives for people to become House members or delegates?

**A:**

While Token House delegates receive direct rewards (like OP token incentives), Citizen House members are incentivized through recognition, influence, and opportunities to shape the ecosystem's future. These incentives are carefully structured to align with the Optimism Collective’s mission of building for the collective good.



### Identity and Reputation

**Problem summary**

We need robust user and project identity within the Optimism Collective as a foundation for Citizenship.This will improve the quality of Token House elections, better support developers on their journey of building on the superchain and create a high trust ecosystem.
In our plan for how to get there, we need to avoid following known pitfalls:
- Products that on their own don’t solve a problem, don’t get adopted.
- Attestations aren’t valuable unless they are being consumed in a real use case.
- There may be a cold start or chicken-and-egg problem in bootstrapping an identity/reputation network.
- Defining the criteria for citizenship ‘top down’ and issuing related attestations misses an opportunity for emergent knowledge.
- Attestations issued for their own sake are at risk of being arbitrary - i.e. not representing anything meaningful for the Optimism Collective.

**Principles**

- Prioritize the things that will help Citizenship emerge organically over defining Citizenship top-down.
- Issue attestations that will be used for something right away rather than issuing attestations for every little thing that might be useful in the future.
- When aggregating data, avoid arbitrary inputs and ensure there is a way to measure effectiveness.
- Design with the expectation that what is built will attract farmers.

**Governance Goals**

- Capture resistance
- Resource allocation


**Multisig vs Security Council**

**Q:**

If making the selection process for multisig signers like the Security Council and the number of signers the same as Security Council members, would it be sufficient not to set up the Security Council?

**A:**

A multisig-based system, even if improved, cannot fully replace the Security Council’s governance role because:
- It lacks the institutional legitimacy and community trust that the Security Council provides.
- It would remain a technical mechanism, unable to serve as a deliberative governance body.
- It is not designed to support progressive decentralization or evolve into a more robust governance structure.

Process TLDR

- Proposals are reviewed over a three week voting cycle.
- If you’re submitting a grant application, you’ll need to submit your application as outlined on each individual Mission Request in github.
- For all other proposal types, you may draft a proposal based on this template and post it on the Forum with [Draft] in the title for feedback. Delegates and/or Citizens will provide feedback on your proposal in the forum. Use your judgment to incorporate feedback.
- Once your non-grant proposal has been approved by four top 100 delegates or four Citizens add a link to your proposal to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 2 and update the title from [Draft] to [Final]. These proposals will move on to Week 3 voting. Proposals initiated by the Foundation do not require approvals.
- Protocol or Governor Upgrades approved by the Token House, must also pass the Citizens’ House Veto Procedure, as outlined in the Veto Procedure section above, before they are considered officially approved.
- The Security Council will enact officially approved Protocol or Governor Upgrades. The Optimism Foundation will facilitate the administration of all other approved proposals, including by distributing any approved OP grants. The Foundation will be in touch to collect additional information from your project in order to execute the proposal or grant, including information to perform KYC.
- If your proposal is passed, the Optimism Foundation will facilitate its administration, including by distributing any approved OP grants. The Foundation will be in touch to collect additional information from your project in order to execute the proposal or grant, including information to perform KYC.
- If your proposal fails, you can make a new proposal in the next cycle specifying how you have incorporated significant changes from your first proposal.

**Q:**

**Why Do Veto Votes Use OP Token Power in the Citizen House?**

**A:**

The Citizen House’s veto threshold is tied to votable OP tokens, even though the Citizen House itself is identity-based, for the following reasons:

Checks and Balances:

Token House proposals often impact OP token holders directly (e.g., token distribution, funding allocations).
Using OP token power in the veto process ensures that the opposition reflects the weight of economic stakeholders.
Preventing Overreach:

If the Citizen House could veto proposals purely based on Citizen votes, it might introduce a risk of disproportionate influence by a smaller group of Citizens.
Tying veto thresholds to OP token power ensures vetoes reflect broad, ecosystem-wide opposition.
